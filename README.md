## **Notice**

October 2nd, 2020 - HorribleSubs has shut down. The web API this package relied on is gone too so this package will not work anymore.
HorribleSubs was just an automated crunchyroll bot so it's not a big loss. Check out Erai-raws or SubsPlease if you need an alternative anime tracker.
